## Overview
### Description

Moves is an application that helps users decide on what to do, such as weekend activities, dining options, and travel destinations. When creating an account, users will input information about themselves so that the app can make informed decisions when giving suggestions. Once a user acts on the decision, the user will rate the decision, allowing the app to learn more about the user and make more accurate predictions about what the user will enjoy doing. 

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Entertainment / Lifestyle / Reference
- **Mobile:** App (website could also be available but app is more convenient)
- **Story:** You / group of friends have a hard time choosing what to do and end up wasting time choosing, can be helpful in a new place or hometown
- **Market:** everyone, realistically probably used mosly by younger generation
- **Habit:** very habit forming, app gets to know you, quick decisions leads to more memories made b/c less time choosing what to do
- **Scope:** Using accumulative data on a person, could begin by giving options depending on age/interests, becomes more accurate with use (can be merged with local suggestions app idea below)
